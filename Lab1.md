instructions: 
A screenshot or Markdown code block showing the command and its output
What the working directory was when the command was run
A sentence or two explaining why you got that output (e.g. what was in the filesystem, what it meant to have no arguments).
Indicate whether the output is an error or not, and if it’s an error, explain why it’s an error.

**Command `cd`**

1. using the command with no arguments

- The working directory when the command was run was `/home`.
- There was no output since the command is meant to change the directory but no desired directory/location in tge filesystem was given.
- There was no error.

2. using the command with a path to a directory as an argument

- The working directory when the command was run was `/home`.
- I got this output because the working directory was changed to `/home/lab1/playlist/`, as is seen in the second line on the terminal.
- There was no error.

3. using the command with a path to a file as an argument

![Image](13.png)

- The working directory when the command was run was `/home/lab1/playlist/`
- The output was generated since we tried setting the working directory to a file instead of another directory.
- There was an error, informing us that we did not input a valid directory name.

**Command `ls`**

1. using the command with no arguments

- The working directory when the command was run was `/home/lab1/`.
- The output lists the files/directories in the working directory. In this case it was just another directory called `playlist`
- There was no error.

2. using the command with a path to a directory as an argument

- The working directory when the command was run was `/home/lab1/`.
- I got this output because the working directory was changed to `/home/lab1/playlist/`, as is seen in the second line on the terminal.
- There was no error.

3. using the command with a path to a file as an argument
