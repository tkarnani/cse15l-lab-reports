### **Command `cd`**

Task 1: using the command with no arguments

- The working directory when the command was run was `/home`.
- There was no output since the command is meant to change the directory but no desired directory/location in the filesystem was given.
- There was no error.

Task 2: using the command with a path to a directory as an argument

- The working directory when the command was run was `/home`.
- I got this output because the working directory was changed to `/home/lab1/playlist/`, as is seen in the second line on the terminal.
- There was no error.

Task 3: using the command with a path to a file as an argument

- The working directory when the command was run was `/home/lab1/playlist/`.
- The output was generated since we tried setting the working directory to a file instead of another directory.
- There was an error, informing us that we did not input a valid directory name.

### **Command `ls`**

Task 1: using the command with no arguments

- The working directory when the command was run was `/home/lab1/`.
- The output lists the files/directories in the working directory. In this case it was just another directory called `playlist`.
- There was no error.

Task 2: using the command with a path to a directory as an argument

![Image](22.png)

- The working directory when the command was run was `/home/lab1/`.
- The output lists the files/directories in the directory that was input i.e. `/playlist` in the working one. In this case there were files called `song1.txt`,`song2.class` and `song2.java`.
- There was no error.

Task 3: using the command with a path to a file as an argument

![Image](23.png)

- The working directory when the command was run was `/home/lab1/playlist/`
- The output just contains the names of the files that we input.
- There was no error.

### **Command `cat`**

Task 1: using the command with no arguments

![Image](31.png)

- The working directory when the command was run was `/home/lab1/playlist/`.
- The terminal reads your input and prints it back.
- There was no error.

Task 2: using the command with a path to a directory as an argument

![Image](32.png)

- The working directory when the command was run was `/home/lab1/`.
- The output informs us that what we input was a directory and not a file whose contents could be printed out.
- There was an error, since we input a directory instead of a file. This command needs a file in order to print its contents.

Task 3: using the command with a path to a file as an argument

![Image](33(2).png)

- The working directory when the command was run was `/home/lab1/playlist/`
- The output just contains the contents of the file that we input.
- There was no error.
