The steps I performed as a part of the lab report:

1. Delete any existing forks of the repository you have on your account
2. Fork the repository
3. **The real deal** - Start the timer!
4. Log into ieng6
5. Clone your fork of the repository from your Github account (using the SSH URL)
6. Run the tests, demonstrating that they fail
7. Edit the code file to fix the failing test
8. Run the tests, demonstrating that they now succeed
9. Commit and push the resulting change to your Github account (you can pick any commit message!)
